On Linux systems, the utility container idea may not work as well as the tutorial describes.
In Linux, by default Docker runs as the "root" user,
so when we do a lot of the things that the tutorial are advocating for with utility containers,
the files that get written to the bind mount have ownership and permissions of the Linux root user.
See Lecture 109 to resolve this issue.
